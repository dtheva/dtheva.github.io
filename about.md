I am a PhD student studying Neuroscience under the Neuroscience Collaborative The Graduate Center of the City University of New York.  I work in [Dan McCloskey's Lab] (https://mccloskey.neuro.nyc) at the College of Staten Island where we are interested in the physiological and behavioral dynamics of the African Naked Mole-Rat.
